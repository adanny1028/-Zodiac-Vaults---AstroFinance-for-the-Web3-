## Zodiac Vaults

**Zodiac Vaults** is a revolutionary DeFi protocol that combines decentralized finance with astrological personalization. Users can stake their crypto in vaults aligned with their zodiac sign, accessing unique yield strategies that reflect each sign’s traits (e.g., bold strategies for Aries, stable approaches for Taurus).

Our vaults automatically adjust strategies based on significant astrological events, such as lunar phases or planetary retrogrades, seamlessly integrating cosmic influence into finance.

- **Built on Polygon (L2):** Enjoy fast and low-cost transactions for a smooth and accessible user experience.
- **Powered by Orbs (L3):** Automates the astrological logic, ensuring each vault responds dynamically to cosmic movements.
- **Zealy Community:** Our community grows and thrives on Zealy, where users can participate, learn, and be rewarded for their engagement.

**Our mission:** To make finance feel like fate—allowing every user to experience a unique financial journey aligned with their birth chart, the universe’s movements, and the power of community.
