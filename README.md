Zodiac Vaults is a DeFi protocol that combines decentralized finance with astrology-based personalization. Users can stake crypto in vaults aligned to their zodiac sign, with unique yield strategies based on sign traits (e.g., risk-loving Aries vs stable Taurus). Vaults adjust based on astrological events like new moons or retrogrades.
